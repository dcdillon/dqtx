A library of Qt extensions I have found useful

#### QSparkLineWidget
QSparkLineWidget is a widget that draws a spark line (small graph) of a time series.  It is useful in QTableWidgets as an easy way of visualizing trends in data.

#### QSparkLineAndBarsWidget
QSparkLineAndBarsWidget is a widget that displays a spark line on top and a bar chart on the bottom.  It tracks two coincident time series.  It makes the most sense when the line tracks a value over time and the bars track an event count of some sort over time (think price and volume for a stock).
